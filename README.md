A web project to my mom's bakery!

When I was trying to learn web development I was feeling lost about what to do, and then I thought to my self: "Why not help my mom with her bakery?" ... so I decided to start building a webside for her bakery and learn in the process.

I remember that taking curstomer orders used to be a difficult task. We had existing software for this, but it wasn't good enough for our specific needs. That's what I'm aiming to solve with this project.

Below you can see some ideias that I'll implement in this project. Suggestions are accepted!
